# **Portfolio Overview**

Welcome to my portfolio, where you can explore my expertise in **Data Science**, **Web Design**, and **Python Coding**. Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, skills, and experiences that demonstrate my proficiency in these areas.

## **Data Science**

In the *Data Science* section, you'll find a collection of projects and analyses that highlight my ability to:

- **Manipulate and clean data**: I can wrangle raw data and prepare it for analysis using tools like Pandas, Numpy, and SQL.

- **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**: I can uncover trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets using visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

- **Build predictive models**: I can create and train machine learning models using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras to make accurate predictions and inform decision-making.

- **Communicate insights**: I can effectively communicate complex data insights to both technical and non-technical audiences through clear visualizations and concise reports.

## **Web Design**

The *Web Design* section features a variety of websites I've developed, demonstrating my ability to:

- **Design responsive layouts**: I can create visually appealing and functional websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Implement interactive features**: I can add interactivity to websites using JavaScript, jQuery, and other front-end libraries and frameworks.

- **Optimize for performance**: I can ensure websites load quickly and efficiently by optimizing images, minifying code, and implementing caching strategies.

- **Follow accessibility best practices**: I can develop websites that are accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG guidelines and using ARIA roles.

## **Python Coding**

In the *Python Coding* section, you'll find examples of my Python projects, showcasing my skills in:

- **Scripting**: I can automate tasks and processes using Python scripts, improving efficiency and reducing manual effort.

- **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: I can design and implement well-structured, modular, and maintainable Python code using classes and objects.

- **Web scraping**: I can extract data from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, enabling data-driven decision-making.

- **Testing and debugging**: I can write unit tests and use debugging tools to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
